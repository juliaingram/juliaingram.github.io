            <h3>Trapped Under Trucks</h3>
           For this joint investigation with ProPublica, I worked on analyzing federal databases of vehicle crashes to help show the extent of underreporting of underride crashes. I also reported on and reverse-engineered government cost-benefit analysis of mandating metal guards that could prevent these types of crashes, to better understand how they were underestimating the benefits.

            Low drug reimbursement rates and high fees set by pharmacy benefit managers are threatening independent pharmacies in areas of New York State already facing primary care shortages. I collected data on pharmacy closures by scraping a state website and developed a reliable way of classifying the pharmacies as independent or not. I also geocoded the data and performed a spatial analysis to identify the rate of closures in areas federally designated to be facing a primary care shortage.

              Stanford disbanded the TDX fraternity after a student died of an accidental overdose in its on-campus house.
