            <p>Teletherapy apps advertise easy access to mental healthcare. But hundreds of users report never hearing from therapists, an analysis of reviews from the Apple App Store shows.</p>
            <p>Reviews of the apps Talkspace and Cerebral since January 2020 stood out: while their reviews include success stories of people who were helped by the apps, they sit alongside a combined estimated 500 users who reported being charged unfairly and 375 who never heard from or experienced long wait times for therapists.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;No therapists. No responsiveness from anyone. They do not care,&rdquo; one user wrote about Talkspace, which matches users with licensed mental healthcare providers for video and text counseling.&nbsp;</p>
            <div class='viz-container'>
                <iframe title="Talkspace, Cerebral users face issues with insurance" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-OvAEM" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OvAEM/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="279"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
                </script>
            </div>
            <p>To identify the nature of the apps&rsquo; negative reviews, over 3,000 reviews for 10 teletherapy apps were scraped from the App Storel roughly 1,500 each from Talkspace and Cerebral. One- and two-star reviews were then analyzed with a machine learning algorithm that predicted whether they fell into one or more of three categories: an unfair charge, unresponsive therapist or an unsatisfactory one.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Again, despite these negative experiences, the majority of reviews for the 10 apps were positive. Talkspace, BetterHelp and Cerebral all have a 4.7 or higher rating on the app store.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But the negative reviews mirror issues in traditional forms of therapy: mismatches between patient and therapist, long wait times and expensive charges. They underscore that longstanding issues in mental healthcare aren&rsquo;t solved with an app or the option to video chat.&nbsp;</p>
