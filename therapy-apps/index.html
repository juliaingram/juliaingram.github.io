                In the early months of the pandemic, many New Yorkers turned from subways and buses to cycling. Bike sales jumped, and so did use of the city's bike-share system, Citi Bike. 
                <br><br>Now, with the city long reopened, Citi Bike ridership is at an all-time high, with a record 3.3 million rides logged in September 2021, the company's highest monthly total. 
                Between 2018 and 2021, total annual Citi Bike rides have jumped 58%, data <a href='https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data'>published by the company</a> shows.
                <br><br>But ridership patterns throughout the day have shifted, an analysis of the last four years of New York City ridership data shows. In the work-from-home era, the data shows suggests that people are using Citi Bike more everyday travel and less for commuting during the pandemic.

            <p class='subhead'>Citi Bike's growth</p>
            <p>Cycling has exploded across New York City during the pandemic. The city saw a 33% growth in cycling between May and December 2020 and a 63% growth in weekend cycling over the same timeframe, according to the Department of Transit's latest <a href='https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/cycling-in-the-city-2021.pdf'>report</a> on cycling trends, released September 2021. 
            <br><br>That growth is reflected in Citi Bike, as ridership has exceeded 2019 monthly ridership levels since October 2020. MTA Subway ridership, on the other hand, has only reached half of what it was before the pandemic, according to <a href='https://new.mta.info/coronavirus/ridership'>daily ridership data</a> released by the agency.
